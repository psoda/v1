// Evaluator is a friend class to Tree so he can access the structures
// Base class for Evaluator and Algorithms, Search, so we can overload

Interpreter creates algorithm, evaluator
    Interpreter passes algorithm and evaluator to search
    Evaluator classes have empty implementations for all 
    Evaluator base class has virtual implementations for all 

Interpreter calls normal parsimony to build datasets
We differentiate in the search
The TreeIinfo contains an index into the dataset so normal routines can get to them.

Interpreter.cpp and Parsimony.cpp will be both Q and not Q. Everything else will migrate.
