<p><strong>Alignment Window Calculate Menu</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sort </strong> 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>by ID</strong><em><br>
        This will sort the sequences according to sequence name. If the sort is 
        repeated, the order of the sorted sequences will be inverted. </em></li>
      <li><strong>by Group</strong><strong><br>
        </strong><em>This will sort the sequences according to sequence name. 
        If the sort is repeated, the order of the sorted sequences will be inverted. 
        </em><strong></strong></li>
      <li><strong>by Pairwise Identity<br>
        </strong><em>This will sort the selected sequences by their percentage 
        identity to the consensus sequence. The most similar sequence is put at 
        the top. </em></li>
      <li><em>The <a href="../calculations/sorting.html">Sort menu</a> will have 
        some additional options if the alignment has any associated
	score annotation, or you have just done a multiple alignment calculation
        or opened a tree viewer window.</em><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Calculate Tree </strong> <br>
    <em>Functions for calculating trees on the alignment or the currently selected 
    region. See <a
    href="../calculations/tree.html">calculating trees</a>.</em> 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Average Distance Using % Identity</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Neighbour Joining Using % Identity</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Average Distance Using Blosum62</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Neighbour Joining Using Blosum62<br>
        </strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pairwise Alignments</strong><br>
    <em>Applies Smith and Waterman algorithm to selected sequences. See <a href="../calculations/pairwise.html">pairwise 
    alignments</a>.</em><br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Principal Component Analysis</strong><br>
    <em>Shows a spatial clustering of the sequences based on the BLOSUM62 scores 
    in the alignment. See <a href="../calculations/pca.html">Principal Component 
    Analysis</a>.</em> <br>
  </li>
 	<li><strong>Extract Scores ... (optional)</strong><br>
		<em>This option is only visible if Jalview detects one or more white-space separated values in the description line of the alignment sequences.<br>
		When selected, these numbers are parsed into sequence associated annotation which can 
		then be used to sort the alignment via the Sort by&#8594;Score menu.</em> <br>
	</li>
  
  <li><strong>Autocalculate Consensus</strong><br>
    <em>For large alignments it can be useful to deselect &quot;Autocalculate 
    Consensus&quot; when editing. This prevents the sometimes lengthy calculations 
    performed after each sequence edit.</em> <br>
  </li>
</ul>
