<ul>
	<li><strong>Fetch Sequence</strong><br>
	<em>Shows a dialog window in which you can select known ids from
	Uniprot, EMBL, EMBLCDS or PDB database using Web Services provided by
	the European Bioinformatics Institute. See <a
		href="../features/seqfetch.html">Sequence Fetcher</a></em>.</li>
	<li><strong>Add Sequences</strong><em><br>
	Add sequences to the visible alignment from file, URL, or cut &amp;
	paste window </em></li>
	<li><strong>Reload</strong><em><br>
	Reloads the alignment from the original file, if available.<br>

	colourings applied since the alignment was last saved, and cannot be
	undone.</strong></em></li>
	<li><strong>Save (Control S)</strong><em><br>
	Saves the alignment to the file it was loaded from (if available), in
	the same format, updating the original in place. </em></li>
	<li><strong>Save As (Control Shift S)<br>
	</strong><em>Save the alignment to local file. A file selection window will
	open, use the &quot;Files of type:&quot; selection box to determine
	which <a href="../io/index.html">alignment format</a> to save as.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Output to Textbox<br>
	</strong><em>The alignment will be displayed in plain text in a new window,
	which you can &quot;Copy and Paste&quot; using the pull down menu, or
	your standard operating system copy and paste keys. The output window
	also has a <strong>&quot;New Window&quot;</strong> button to import the
	(possibly edited) text as a new alignment.<br>
	Select the format of the text by selecting one of the following menu
	items.</em>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>FASTA</strong> <em></em></li>
		<li><strong>MSF</strong></li>
		<li><strong>CLUSTAL</strong></li>

	<li><strong>Page Setup ...</strong><br>
	<em>Open the printing system's Page Setup dialog box, to
	control page size, layout and orientation.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Print (Control P)<br>
	</strong><em>Jalview will print the alignment using the current fonts and
	colours of your alignment. If the alignment has annotations visible,
	these will be printed below the alignment. If the alignment is wrapped
	the number of residues per line of your alignment will depend on the
	paper width or your alignment window width, whichever is the smaller. </em></li>
	<li><strong>Export Image</strong> <em><br>
	Creates an alignment graphic with the current view's annotation,
	alignment background colours and group colours. If the alignment is <a
		href="../features/wrap.html">wrapped</a>, the output will also be
	wrapped and will have the same visible residue width as the open
	alignment. </em>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>HTML<br>
		</strong><em>Create a <a href="../io/export.html">web page</a> from your
		alignment.</em></li>

		Postscript</a> file from your alignment.</em></li>

	alignment. Note: the ids of the tree file and your alignment MUST be
	the same.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Load Features / Annotations<br>
	</strong><em>Load files describing precalculated <a
