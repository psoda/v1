<p><strong>Sequence Fetcher</strong></p>
<p>Jalview can retrieve sequences from certain databases using either the
WSDBFetch service provided by the European Bioinformatics Institute, and DAS servers capable of the <em>sequence</em> command (<em>since version 2.4</em>).</p>
<img src="seqfetcher.gif" align="center" alt="The Jalview Sequence Fetcher Dialog Box">
<p>The Sequence Fetcher dialog box can be opened via the &quot;File&quot; 
  menu on the main desktop in order to retrieve sequences as a new
  alignment, or opened via the &quot;File&quot; menu of an existing alignment
  to import additional sequences. Please note, there will be a short delay when the sequence fetcher is first opened, 
  whilst Jalview compiles the list of available sequence datasources from the 
  currently defined DAS server registry.</strong>
</p>
<p>First, select the database you want to retrieve sequences from. Then, enter
  one or more accession ids (as a semi-colon separated list), or press the 
  &quot;Example&quot; button to paste the example accession for the currently selected database into the retrieval box.
   Finally, press &quot;OK&quot; to initiate the retrieval.</p>
<p>
  If you are retrieving sequences from the PDB, you can retrieve
  specific chains by appending a colon and the chain id to the PDB
  id. For example :<br><pre> 1GAQ:A</pre><br>When retrieving from DAS sequence sources,
  coordinate range arguments can be passed to the server using the standard DAS 
  sequence command format (<strong>:&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;</strong>)</p>
<p>If you use the WSDBFetch sequence fetcher services (EMBL, Uniprot, PDB and PFAM)
