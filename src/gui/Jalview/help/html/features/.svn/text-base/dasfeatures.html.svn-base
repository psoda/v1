<p><strong>DAS Sequence Feature Retrieval</strong></p>
<p>Jalview includes a client for retrieving sequence features via
the <a href="http://www.biodas.org">Distributed Annotation System</a>.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open the Feature Settings panel by selecting &quot;View -&gt;
	Feature Settings...&quot;</li>
	<li>Click on the &quot;<a href="dassettings.html">DAS Settings</a>&quot;
	tabbed pane.</li>
	<li>Select the sources to use for DAS feature retireval, then
	click the &quot;Fetch DAS Features&quot; button.
	<ul>
		<li>Cancelling Feature Retrieval<br>
		Press the <strong>Cancel Fetch</strong> button to immediately stop
		feature retrieval. This will not remove any features already added to
		the alignment, but will halt any outstanding DAS requests.<em>The
		cancel fetch button is of particular use when one or more DAS
		annotation servers are not responding!</em>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>If your DAS source selection contains sources which use Uniprot
accession ids, you will be asked whether Jalview should find Uniprot
Accession ids for the given sequence names. It is important to realise
that many DAS sources only use Uniprot accession ids, rather than
Swissprot/Uniprot sequence names.<br>
The <a href="../webservices/dbreffetcher.html">database reference
fetcher</a> documentation describes how Jalview discovers what database
references are appropriate for the sequences in the alignment.
<ul>
	<li><em>Note</em><br>
	Please remember to save your alignment if either the start/end
	numbering, or the sequence IDs were updated during the ID 
	retrieval process.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;
<p><em>DAS support was introduced in Jalview Version 2.1.</em></p>
