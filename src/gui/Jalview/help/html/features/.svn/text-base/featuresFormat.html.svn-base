<p><strong>Sequence Features File</strong></p>
<p>The Sequence features file (which used to be known as the
&quot;Groups file&quot; prior to version 2.08) is a simple way of
getting your own sequence annotations into Jalview. It was introduced to
allow sequence features to be rendered in the Jalview applet, and so is
intentionally lightweight and minimal because the applet is often used
in situations where data file size must be kept to a minimum, and no XML
parser is available.</p>
<p>Features files are imported into Jalview in the following ways:<br>
<ul>
	<li>from the command line<strong><pre>
 -features &lt;<em>Features filename</em>&gt;</pre></strong></li>
	<li>Dragging a features file onto an alignment window</li>
	<li>Via the &quot;Load Features / Annotations&quot; entry in the <strong>File</strong>
	menu of an alignment window.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Sequence Features File Format</strong></p>
<p>A features file is a simple ASCII text file, where each line
contains tab separated text fields. <strong>No comments are
allowed</strong>.</p>
<p>The first set of lines contain type definitions:<strong>
<pre><em>Feature label</em>&#9;<em>Feature Colour</em></pre> </strong>A feature
type has a text label, and a colour (specified as a red,green,blue 24
bit triplet either in hexadecimal (eg. 00ff00) or as comma separated
numbers (ranging from 0 to 255)). The text label may contain simple HTML
document body tags if enclosed by &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;
and will be rendered as formatted tooltips in the Jalview Application
(the Jalview applet is not capable of rendering HTML tooltips, so all
formatting tags will be removed.</p>
<p>The remaining lines in the file are the sequence annotation
definitions, where the now defined features are attached to regions on
particular sequences, optionally with some descriptive text (displayed
in a tooltip when the mouse is near the feature on that sequence). There
are two alternate ways of referring to a sequence, either by its text
ID, or its index in an associated alignment.
<pre>
<em>description</em>&#9;<em>sequenceId</em>&#9;<em>sequenceIndex</em>&#9;<em>start</em>&#9;<em>end</em>&#9;<em>featureType</em></pre>
Normally, sequence features are associated with sequences rather than
alignments, and the sequenceIndex field is given as &quot;-1&quot;. In
order to specify a sequence by its index in a particular alignment, the
sequenceId should be given as &quot;ID_NOT_SPECIFIED&quot;, otherwise
the sequenceId field will be used in preference to the sequenceIndex
field.
</p>
<p>Feature annotations can be collected into named groups by
prefixing definitions with lines of the form:<strong><pre>startgroup&#9;groupname</pre></strong>..
and subsequently post-fixing the group with:<strong><pre>endgroup&#9;groupname</pre></strong>Feature
grouping was introduced in version 2.08, and used to control whether a
set of features are either hidden or shown together in the <a
	href="seqfeatures.html">sequence Feature settings dialog box</a>.</p>
