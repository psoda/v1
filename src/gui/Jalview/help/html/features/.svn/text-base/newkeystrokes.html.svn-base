<strong>New Key Strokes and Menus</strong>
<p>Many new <a href="../keys.html">keyboard shortcuts</a> have been
added in Jalview 2.2 to make editing, selecting and navigating an
alignment even easier. The selection commands in the <strong>Edit</strong>
menu, and the alignment formatting controls within the <strong>View</strong>
menu have also been moved into their own respective <strong>Select</strong>
and <strong>Format</strong> menus.</p>
<p>Some of the more important new keystrokes are shown below :
<ul>
	<li><strong>Page Up</strong> and <strong>Page Down</strong>
	scrolls through the alignment view.</li>
	<li><strong>Control I</strong> inverts the currently selected
	sequence set, and <strong>Control Alt I</strong> will invert the
	currently selected set of columns.
	<li><strong>Control V</strong> will paste the contents of the
	clipboard to the current alignment window, and <strong>Control
	Shift V</strong> pastes the data to a new window.</li>
	<li><strong>Control O</strong> opens the file browser for loading
	a new alignment or Jalview archive.</li>
	<li><strong>Control S</strong> saves the alignment with the
	current filename and format, and <strong>Control Shift S</strong> opens
	the <strong>Save As...</strong> dialog box.</li>
	<li><strong>Control T</strong> creates a new alignment view, and <strong>Control
	W</strong> closes the current view, or if none remain, then the whole alignment.</li>
	<li><strong>Control E</strong> will remove gapped columns in the alignment.</li>
	<li><strong>Control D</strong> opens the <strong>Remove Redundancy</strong> dialog box.</li>
</ul>
