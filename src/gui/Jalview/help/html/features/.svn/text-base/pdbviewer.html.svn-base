<p><strong>The Jalview internal PDB Viewer</strong><br>
Since Jalview 2.3, the <a href="jmol.html">Jmol PDB Viewer</a> is
the main method for <a href="viewingpdbs.html">viewing PDB
structures</a>. The documentation below concerns the original Jalview
PDB viewer, which is only used in situations where Jmol is unavailable
or cannot operate.</p>
<p><strong>The PDB Viewer Window</strong>
<p>This interactive structure viewing window is opened by selecting
the <strong>&quot;Sequence&#8594;View PDB entry:&quot;</strong> entry in
the <a href="../menus/popupMenu.html">sequence id pop-up menu</a>. This
can only be done for sequences which have an <a href="viewingpdbs.html">associated
PDB structure</a>, and the PDB Viewer will only be associated with the
particular alignment view from which it was opened.</p>
<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>
<p>The structure is rendered as an alpha-carbon trace. Moving the
mouse over the structure brings up tooltips with a residue name and PDB
sequence position. If a mapping exists to a residue in the associated
sequence, then this will be highlighted in the associated view in its
alignment window, and vice versa for viewing the coordinates associated
with a particular residue in the sequence in a particular view on the
alignment.</p>
<p>Selecting a residue highlights its associated sequence residue
and alpha carbon location.</p>

<p>There are three menus:
<ul>
	<li><Strong>File<br>
	</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Save As<br>
		</strong><em>Saves the current view as an EPS or PNG file.</em></li>
		<li><strong>View Mapping<br>
		</strong><em> Opens a text window showing the alignment between the
		residues corresponding to alpha-carbon atoms in the PDB structure and
		the residues in the associated sequence.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Colours<br>
	</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>By Sequence<br>
		</strong><em> Colours each residue in the structure with the colour of its
		corresponding residue in the associated sequence as rendered in the
		associated alignment view, including any Uniprot sequence features or
		region colourings.<br>
		Residues which only exist in the PDB structure are coloured white if
		they are insertions (relative to the associated sequence in the
		alignment) and grey if they are N or C terminal flanks outside the
		region mapped to the alignment window's sequence.</em></li>
		<li><strong>By Chain<br>
		</strong><em> Assigns a random colour to each PDB chain.</em>
		<li><strong>Charge &amp; Cysteine<br>
		</strong><em> Highlights cysteines in yellow, anionic (Aspartic Acid or
		Glutamic Acid) residues in red, and cationic (Lysine or Arginine)
		residues in blue.</em></li>
		<li><strong><em>Standard and User Defined Jalview
		colourschemes.<br>
		</em></strong> The remaining entries apply the colourschemes available from the
		standard and user defined <a href="../colourSchemes/index.html">amino
		acid colours</a>.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>View<br>
	</strong><em> These options can be turned off to improve performance when
	viewing large structures, some at the expense of visual clarity.</em>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Wireframe<br>
		</strong><em> Draws thin lines rather than thick lines for the
		alpha-carbon trace.</em></li>
		<li><strong>Depthcue<br>
		</strong><em>Shades the structure so parts of the structure near the front
		of the view are brighter than those further away.</em></li>
		<li><strong>Z Buffering<br>
		</strong><em> Applies depth sorting to correctly render occluded regions
		of the backbone trace.</em></li>
		<li><strong>Show All Chains<br>
		</strong><em> When turned on, shows all chains in the PDB file, not just
		the one associated with a sequence in the alignment window.</em></li>
		<!--  NOT YET IMPLEMENTED <li><strong>Associate View</strong><br>
		Change which view on the associated sequence's alignment is to be
		associated with the PDB viewer.-->

<p><strong>Notes for PDB Viewing in the Jalview Applet</strong>
<p>The applet can only load PDB files by copying and pasting the
text into the popup window which appears when &quot;Show PDB
Structure&quot; is selected after right clicking on a sequence name.</p>
