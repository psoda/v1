<p><strong>Search</strong></p>
<p>The search box is displayed by pressing Control and F or
  selecting &quot;Find...&quot; from the &quot;Search&quot; menu.</p>
<img src="search.gif" width="339" height="110">
<p>&quot;Find next&quot; will find the next occurence of the specified and adjust 
  the alignment window view to show it, and &quot;Find all&quot; highlights all 
  matches for a pattern. The &quot;New Feature&quot; is a quick way to highlight 
  and group residues matching the specified search pattern throughout the alignment. 
<ul>
  <li>The search uses regular expressions. (understands a mixture of posix and 
    perl style regex - see below for a summary)</li>
  <li>Gaps are ignored when matching the query to the sequences in the alignment.</li>
  <li>The search is applied to both sequences and their IDs but the &quot;Find 
    next&quot; and &quot;Find all&quot; buttons only count the sequence matches.</li>
  <li>If a region is selected, then search will <strong>only</strong> be performed 
    on that region. </li>
  <li>To quickly clear the current selection, press the &quot;Escape&quot; key.</li>
  <li>Tick the &quot;Match Case&quot; box to perform a case sensitive search.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Creating Features from Search Results</strong></p>
<p>
  If &quot;New Feature&quot; is selected, the feature can be given a name from 
  a popup input box. Use the &quot;Feature Settings&quot; under the &quot;View&quot; 
  menu to change the visibility and colour of the new sequence feature.</p> 
<p><strong>A quick Regular Expression Guide</strong></p>
<p>A regular expression is not just a simple text query - although it
can be used like one, the query is not parsed literally, but
interpreted like a series of instructions defining the features of the
match. For example, a simple query like &quot;ACDED&quot; would
match all occurences of that string, but &quot;ACD+ED&quot; matches
both 'ACDDED' and 'ACDDDDDDDDED'. More usefully, the query
&quot;[ILGVMA]{;5,}&quot; would find stretches of small,
hydrophobic amino acids of at least five residues in length.
</p>
<p> The table
below describes some of the regular expression syntax:<br></p>
