<p><strong>DAS Settings</strong></p>
<p>Jalview can retrieve and visualize features from many <a href="http://biodas.org/">DAS</a> 
  sources at once. The DAS sources are discovered and selected <em>via</em> the DAS settings panel.</p>
<p><img src="das.gif">
<p>The available sources are listed in the table using each source's
Nickname as its identifier. Clicking on a source's entry in the table
reveals more information about that service in the panel to the
right. Select the tickbox in the &quot;Use Source&quot; column for a
source to add it to the set Jalview queries for alignment and sequence
features.
</p>
<p>You can filter the visible DAS sources by authority, type and &quot;label&quot;. 
  You should read the DAS documentation to understand more about these values.
<p><strong>Updating the list of sources</strong></p>
<p>When the DAS Settings panel is first opened, and when the <strong>'Refresh
  source'</strong> buton is pressed, a list of DAS sources
  is retrieved from the DAS registry URL (set by default to the DAS
  registration server at
  http://das.sanger.ac.uk/registry/das1/sources/).</p>
<p><strong>Adding your own DAS Sources</strong></p>
<p>You can add your own DAS source to the list by clicking the &quot;Add Local 
  Source&quot; button. Enter the URL and nickname of your additional service. 
  It should be noted that Jalview 2.1 will not query additional sources for more 
  information, but this will be implemented in future editions.
