<p><strong>Multiple Alignment Views</strong></p>
<p>Multiple alignment views allows the same alignment to be viewed
independently in many different ways simultaneously. Each view is an
independent visualization of the same alignment, so each may have a
different ordering, colouring, row and column hiding and seuqence
feature and annotation display setting, but alignment, feature and
annotation edits are common to all, since this affects the underlying
data.</p>
<p>Create a new view using the <strong>&quot;View&#8594;New
View&quot;</strong> menu item, or by pressing <strong>Control+T</strong>. A newly
created view will be identical to the view it was created from, but any
changes to the way the alignment is coloured or displayed will only
affect the new view.</p>
<p>A particular view may focus on some specific aspect of an
alignment - for example, hiding all but the region of an alignment
containing a particular domain. <strong>Right-clicking</strong> a view's
tab opens the View Name dialog box, allowing it to be renamed to
something more meaningful.</p>
<p><strong>Viewing Multiple Views Simultaneously</strong></p>
<p>Multiple views of an alignment are, by default, gathered together
as tabs within a single alignment window. They can be viewed
simultanously by pressing <strong>X</strong> (or via <strong>&quot;View&#8594;Expand&quot;</strong>)
to expand each view into its own linked alignment window. Expanded views
are gathered back into into a single tabbed alignment window by pressing
<strong>G</strong>, or by selecting <strong>&quot;View&#8594;Gather&quot;</strong>).
</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Sequence Representatives and Multiple
Views</strong></p>
<p>There are some unexpected interactions between hidden sequence
representatives and their display in multiple views. See the
corresponding entry in the <a href="hiddenRegions.html">documentation
for hidden regions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Structure and Analysis Viewers and Multiple
Views</strong></p>
<p>A tree calculated on a particular view, or loaded onto it, is by
default associated with just that view. However, the <a
	href="../calculations/treeviewer.html">Tree Viewer's</a> <strong>&quot;View&#8594;Associate
leaves&quot;</strong> submenu allows a tree's view association to be changed to
to any or all other views.</p>
<p>The results of a <a href="../calculations/pca.html">PCA
calculation</a> on a particular view may also be associated with other
views, using the PCA Viewer's <strong>&quot;View&#8594;Associate
Nodes&quot;</strong> submenu.</p>
<p><a href="jmol.html">PDB Structure Viewers</a>
opened on a structure associated with a sequence in a particular view are now (as of Jalview 2.3) associated with the same sequence in all views. This means that when 'Colour by Sequence' is selected in the structure view, the colour will be updated to the colours given in the view with the current input focus.
<!--
 also, by default, only be associated
with the sequence as it is displayed in that view. The
&quot;View&#8594;Associate View&quot; submenu allows the association of
alternative views.</p> -->
