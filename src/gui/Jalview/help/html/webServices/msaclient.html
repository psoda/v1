<strong>Multiple Sequence Alignment Web Services</strong>
<p>
Multiple sequence alignment services are accessed from the <strong>Web
Service&#8594;Alignment</strong> menu. When an entry from this menu is
selected, either the currently selected residues, or the whole
sequence set (if there is no selection or only one sequence is
selected) will be submitted for multiple sequence alignment.
</p>
<p>There are two kinds of multiple sequence alignment operations
available:<ul>
<li><em>alignment</em> - where a new alignment is constructed from the input
</li>
<li><em>realignment</em> -
where any existing alignments in the input are passed to the service
for profile based alignment.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Multiple Alignments of Sequences with hidden columns</strong><br>
Multiple alignment services are 'column separable' analysis
operations. If the input contains <a
href="../features/hiddenRegions.html">hidden columns</a> then each
visible segment of the input sequence set will be submitted for
alignment separately, and the results concatenated (with the hidden
regions preserved) once all alignment functions have completed. Each
sub-job's state is reported in its own tab:
