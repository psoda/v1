<p><strong>ClustalW Alignments</strong></p>
<p>ClustalW is a program for multiple sequence alignment. It works
with both DNA and protein sequences, and can also perform profile
profile alignments to align two or more multiple sequence
alignments.</p>

sequence alignment through sequence weighting, position specific gap
penalties and weight matrix choice.<br>

<p>There are two versions of this alignment function, which will operate
on the selected region, if any, or the whole sequence set:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Web Service&#8594;Alignment&#8594;ClustalW Multiple Sequence Alignment</strong><br>
    Aligns using the clustalW program, ignoring any gaps in the submitted sequence 
    set. </li>
  <li><strong>Web Service&#8594;Alignment&#8594;ClustalW Mulitple Sequence Alignment 
    Realign </strong><br>
    Submits the sequences with existing gaps to clustalW, which will preserve 
    existing gaps and re-align those regions which are not optimal. </li>
</ul>
