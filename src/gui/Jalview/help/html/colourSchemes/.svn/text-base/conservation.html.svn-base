<p><em>Colouring by Conservation</em></p>
<p>This is an approach to alignment colouring which highlights
  regions of an alignment where physicochemical properties are
  conserved. It is based on the one used in
  the AMAS method of multiple sequence alignment analysis (Livingstone
  C.D. and Barton G.J. (1993), Protein Sequence Alignments: A Strategy 
  for the Hierarchical Analysis of Residue Conservation.CABIOS Vol. 9
  No. 6 (745-756)). See the <a href="../calculations/conservation.html">conservation calculation</a> help page for
  a more thorough explanation of the calculation.
</p>
<p>For an already coloured alignment, the conservation index at each
  alignment position is used to modify the shading intensity of the
  colour at that position. This means that the most conserved columns
  in each group have the most intense colours, and the least conserved
  are the palest. The slider controls the contrast between these
  extremes.</p>
<p>Conservation can be calculated over all sequences in an alignment, or just
  within specific groups (such as those defined by
  <a href="../calculations/tree.html">phylogenetic tree partitioning</a>).
  The option 'apply to all groups' controls whether the contrast
  slider value will be applied to the indices for the currently
  selected group, or all groups defined over the alignment.</p>
