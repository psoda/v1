<strong>Background Dependent Text Colour</strong>
<p>The <strong>Colour&#8594;Text Colour</strong> menu entry opens
the <strong>&quot;Adjust Foreground Text Colour Threshold&quot;</strong>
dialog box, allowing the colour of symbols rendered on dark or light
backgrounds to be set for the current selection or the whole alignment.
</p>

<p>The dialog box contains a slider, and two colour icons showing
the text colour for dark backgrounds (left hand end of slider), and
light backgrounds (right hand end of slider). Drag the slider to change
the threshold for transitioning between dark and light background
colours, and select either of the colour boxes to open a colour chooser
to select a different text colour.</p>
