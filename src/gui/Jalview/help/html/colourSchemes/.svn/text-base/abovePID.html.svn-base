<p> <em>Colouring above a percentage identity threshold</em></p>
<p> Selecting this option causes the colour scheme to be applied to only those
  residues that occur in that column more than a certain percentage of the time.
  For instance selecting the threshold to be 100 will only colour those columns
  with 100 % identity. This threshold option can be applied to the Zappo, Taylor,
  Hydrophobicity and User colour schemes. </p>
