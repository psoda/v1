<p><strong>Alignment Quality Annotation</strong></p>
<p>Alignment Quality is one of the automatically calculated
quantitative alignment
annotations displayed below the columns of a multiple sequence
alignment (and can be used to shade the alignment). It is an ad-hoc
measure of the likelihood of observing the mutations (if any) in a
particular column of the alignment.</p>
<p>
More precisely, the quality score is inversely proportional to the
average cost of all pairs of mutations oberved in a particular column
of the alignment - a high alignment quality score for a column would
suggest that there are no mutations, or most mutations observed are
favourable.
</p>

<p><em>The Algorithm</em><br>
The quality score is calculated for each column in an alignment by
summing, for all mutations, the ratio of the two BLOSUM 62 scores for
a mutation pair and each residue's conservered BLOSUM62 score (which
is higher). This valueis normalised for each column, and then plotted
on a scale from 0 to 1.
</p>
<p>
Multiple alignment algorithms using the BLOSUM 62 substition matrices
should, in theory, maximise alignment quality for an un-gapped
alignment, and locally maximise quality for gapped alignments.
