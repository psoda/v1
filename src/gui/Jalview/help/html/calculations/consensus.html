<p><strong>Alignment Consensus Annotation</strong></p>
<p>The consensus displayed below the alignment is the percentage of the modal 
  residue per column. By default this calculation takes includes gaps in column. 
  You can choose to ignore gaps in the calculation by right clicking on the label 
  &quot;Consensus&quot; to the left of the consensus bar chart. 
<p>If the modal value is shared by more than 1 residue, a &quot;+&quot; symbol 
  is used in the display for the simple reason that it is not possible to display 
  multiple characters in a single character space.
<p><strong>Copying the consensus sequence</strong></p>
<p>Select the <strong>&quot;Copy Consensus Sequence&quot;</strong> entry from 
the consensus annotation label to copy the alignment's consensus sequence to the 
clipboard.
