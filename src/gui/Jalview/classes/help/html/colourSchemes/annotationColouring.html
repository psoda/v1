<p><strong> Annotation Colouring </strong></p>
<p>Jalview 2.08 allows an alignment to be coloured on a per-column basis based 
  on any numerical annotation added to that alignment. </p>
Select &quot;Colour&quot; <strong>&#8594;</strong> &quot;.. 
  by Annotation&quot; to bring up the Colour by Annotation settings window. <br>
  <br><div align="center">
  <img src="annotationColourSetting.jpg" width="426" height="140"> </div>
<ul>
  <li>Select which annotation to base the colouring scheme on using the top left 
    selection box.</li>
  <li> If the &quot;Use Original Colours&quot; box is selected, the colouring 
    scheme will use the colouring scheme present on the alignment before the Annotation 
    Colour Settings window was displayed. </li>
  <li>The colour scheme can display a colour gradient from a colour representing 
    the minimum value in the selected annotation to a colour representing the 
    maximum value in the selected annotation. Use the &quot;Min Colour&quot; and 
    &quot;Max Colour&quot; to set the colour gradient range.</li>
  <li>Select whether to colour the alignment above or below an adjustable threshold 
    with the selection box center left of the window. </li>
  <li>Change the threshold value with the slider, or enter the exact value in 
    the text box. </li>
</ul>
