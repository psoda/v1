<p><strong>Removing redundancy</strong></p>
<p>Selecting this option brings up a window asking you to select a threshold.
  If the percentage identity between two sequences exceeds this value one of the
  sequences (the shorter) is discarded. The redundancy calculation is done when
  the Apply button is pressed. For large numbers of sequences this can take a
  long time as all pairs have to be compared. </p>
