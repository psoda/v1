<p><strong>The Tree Viewing Window</strong></p>
<p>
  The tree viewing window is opened when a tree has been <a href="tree.html">calculated 
  from an alignment</a>, or imported via a file or web service. It includes <a href="#menus">menus</a> for 
  controlling layout and file and figure creation, and enables 
  various selection and colouring operations on the 
  associated sequences in the alignment.</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Selecting Sequence Leaf Nodes</em></strong><br>
  Selecting sequence ids at the leaves of the tree selects the
  corresponding sequences in the original alignment. These selections
  are also reflected in any other analysis windows associated with the
  alignment, such as another tree viewer.</p>
<p><strong><em>Grouping sequences by partitioning the tree at a particular distanec</em></strong><br>
  Clicking anywhere along the extent of the tree (but not on a leaf or
  internal node) defines a tree 'partition', by cutting every branch
  of the tree spanning the depth where the mouse-click occurred. Groups
  are created containing sequences at the leaves of each connected
  sub tree. These groups are each given a different colour, which are
  reflected in other windows in the same way as if the sequence ids
  were selected, and can be edited in the same way as user defined
  sequence groups.
</p>
<p>Tree partitions are useful for comparing clusters produced by
different methods and measures. They are also an effective way of
identifying specific patterns of conservation and mutation
corresponding to the overall phylogenetic structure, when combined
with the <a href="../colourSchemes/conservation.html">conservation
based colour scheme</a>.</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Selecting Subtrees and changing the branch order and subtree group colour</em></strong><br>
Moving the mouse over an internal node of the tree will highlight
  it. You can then : <ul>
  <li>Click the highlighted node to select all the sequences in that branch.
  <li>Double-click the highlighted node to rearrange the tree
  diagram by inverting the branch ordering at that
  node.
  <li>Right-click to open the 'Select Sub-Tree Colour' dialog box, to
  pick a new colour for the sub-tree and associated sequences.
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong><a name="menus">
File Menu</a></strong></p>
<p>This menu allows the displayed tree to be saved as a Newick tree
file (Save&#8594;Newick File), printed or exported as an image (PNG) or
Postscript file. Finally, data used to calculate the tree can be
retrieved with the 'Input Data...' entry.
</p>
<p><strong>View Menu</strong></p>
<p>When the tree viewer is opened, it displays all the annotation
associated with a tree. Trees calculated by Jalview have branch
lengths, which correspond to the distance measure used to construct
the tree. Tree imported from outside may also contain bootstrap information,
and additional leaves from sequences not present in the associated
alignment.
</p>
<p>The view menu contains options controlling the way a tree is
rendered and labelled:
<ul>
<li><strong>Fit to Window</strong><p>
The tree layout will be scaled to fit in the  display
window. You may need to reduce the font size to minimise the leaf
label overlap when this option is selected.
</p></li>
<li><strong>Font Size ...</strong><em>n</em><p>
Brings up a dialog box to set the font size for the leaf
names. <em>n</em> is the current font size.
</p></li>
<li><strong>Show Distances</strong><p>
Labels each branch or leaf with its associated branch
length.</p></li>
<li><strong>Show Bootstrap values</strong><p>
Labels each branch or leaf with its associated bootstrap value.
</p></li>
<li><strong>Mark unlinked leaves</strong><p>
Toggles the display of a '*' at the beginning of a leaf label to
indicate that there is no sequence corresponding to that leaf in the
associated alignment.
</p></li>
<li><strong>Associate Leaves with ...</strong><p>
Only visible when there are <a href="../features/multipleviews.html">multiple views</a> of the same
alignment to show and edit which alignment views are associated with
the leaves of the displayed tree.
</p>
</ul>
