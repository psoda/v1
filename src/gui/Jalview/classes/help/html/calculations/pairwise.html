<p><strong>Pairwise alignment (Proteins only)</strong></p>
<p>This calculation is performed on the selected sequences only. Java is not the
  fastest language in the world and aligning more than a handful of sequences
  will take a fair amount of time. <br>
  For each pair of sequences the best global alignment is found using BLOSUM62
  as the scoring matrix. The scores reported are the raw scores. The sequences
  are aligned using a dynamic programming technique and using the following gap
  penalties : </p>
<p>Gap open : 12 <br>
  Gap extend : 2 </p>
<p>When you select the pairwise alignment option a new window will come up which
  will display the alignments in a text format as they are calculated. Also displayed
  is information about the alignment such as alignment score, length and percentage
  identity between the sequences.</p>
