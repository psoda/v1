<p><strong>Sorting Sequences</strong></p>
<p>Any group of selected sequences may be reordered by pressing the
up or down arrow keys. The whole alignment may also be reordered by
the use of the functions in the Sort menu (<strong>Calculate&#8594;Sort</strong>):
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sort by ID</strong></p>
<p>Orders the sequences by the alphanumeric (0-9A-Za-z)
precedence of their names.</p><p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sort by Group</strong></p>
<p>Places sequences in the same group adjacent to each other.</p><p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sort by Pairwise Identity</strong></p>
<p>Places pairs of sequences together that align with the greatest
fraction of conserved residues.
</p><p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sort by Tree Order</strong></p>
<p>The leaf ordering of a particular phylogenetic tree is used to
order the sequences corresponding to those leaves in the
alignment.<br>
If a tree has been calculated from or associated with the current
alignment, its name will appear in the submenu <strong>Sort&#8594;By Tree Order</strong>.</p><p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sort by alignment ordering</strong></p>
<p>Multiple alignment methods often order the sequences in their
alignments by some measure of sequence identity.<br>
If the current alignment has been generated by one of Jalview's
alignment web services, the alignment ordering can be recovered by
its corresponding entry in the Sort menu.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sort by Score</strong></p>
<p>This menu appears if the alignment contains any <a href="../features/annotationsFormat.html">sequence associated
alignment annotation</a> with associated score values. Each entry is the
label for a distinct group of sequence associated annotation
scores which can be used for sorting.</p>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reversing the Order</strong></p>
<p>Selecting any item from the Sort menu will sort sequences in an
ascending order according to the property defining the sort. If the
same sort is re-applied, the sequences will be sorted in the inverse
order. In the case of trees and alignment orderings, Jalview will
remember your last choice for sorting the alignment and only apply the
inverse ordering if you select the same tree or alignment ordering
item again.</p>
