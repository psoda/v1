<p><strong>Editing</strong></p>
<p>There are two major ways to edit alignments - in 'Normal mode',
gaps are inserted and deleted at the mouse pointer in various ways by
clicking the left mouse button and pressing a combination of either
shift and control (or the apple key on Macs) and dragging the mouse. Pressing
<em>F2</em> toggles the alternative <a href="../features/cursorMode.html">'Cursor
mode'</a> keyboard editing facility, where the space bar and delete 
keys add and remove gaps at the current editing position. The key
strokes for both these modes are summarised in the <a
href="../keys.html">keystrokes table</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> For large alignments, deselect &quot;Calculate -&gt; 
  Autocalculate Consensus&quot; to prevent the alignment performing lengthy calculations 
  after every edit. </p>
<p><em>Inserting / removing gaps</em> - hold down the
  &quot;Shift&quot; key. Click on a residue with the mouse and drag it
  to the left or right to insert gaps and remove gaps.<br>
  If the current selection is a group over all sequences in the
  alignment, or a group over some sequences or all columns in the
  alignment, then hold down either &quot;Control&quot; 
  key and drag the residue left or right to edit all sequences in the defined 
  group at once.</p>
<p><em>Copy/paste/cut/delete</em> - any sequences which are in the current selection
  box (indicated in red) may be cut and / or copied to a new alignment or deleted.
</p>
<p><em>Undo / redo</em> - editing of sequences (insertion/removal of gaps, removal
  of sequences, trimming sequences etc) may be undone or redone at any time using
  the appropriate menu items from the edit menu. The undo history list only allows
  a maximum of 10 actions.
<p><em>Trimming alignment</em> - First select a column by clicking the scale indicator
  (above the sequences) The alignment may then be trimmed to the left or right
  of this column. If multiple columns are selected, the alignment is trimmed to
  the right of the rightmost selected column (or to the left of the leftmost selected
  column)</p>
<p><em>Remove gapped columns</em> - Removes columns within the alignment which
  contain only space characters (&quot;-&quot; or &quot;.&quot; or &quot; &quot;)</p>
<p><em>Removing gaps</em> - Removes all gaps from the alignment. Gaps are &quot;-&quot;
  or &quot;.&quot; or &quot; &quot;.</p>
<p><em>Set gap character</em> - Switches the gap character between &quot;.&quot; 
  and &quot;-&quot;. If the &quot;Render Gaps&quot; option from the &quot;View&quot; 
  menu is unticked all gaps will appear as blank spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Editing In Selection Areas</strong></p>
Editing can be restricted to the current selection area. 
This allows the user to &quot;Lock&quot; the alignment either side of the selection 
area. Any gap insertions or deletions will only affect the current selection area.

<p>In this example, if Sequence IL2RA_MACMU has gaps removed from position 98-104, 
  the same number of gaps will be inserted at position 116, (between M and L). 
</p>
<p><em>Locked selection area based editing was introduced in Jalview 2.08</em></p>
