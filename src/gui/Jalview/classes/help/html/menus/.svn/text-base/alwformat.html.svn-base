<p><strong>Alignment Window Format Menu</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Font...</strong><br>
    <em>Opens the &quot;Choose Font&quot; dialog box, in order to change the font 
    of the display and enable or disable 'smooth fonts' (anti-aliasing) for faster 
    alignment rendering. </em></em></li>
  <li><strong>Wrap<br>
    </strong><em>When ticked, the alignment display is &quot;<a
		href="../features/wrap.html">wrapped</a>&quot; to the width of the alignment 
    window. This is useful if your alignment has only a few sequences to view 
    its full width at once.<br>
    Additional options for display of sequence numbering and scales are also visible 
    in wrapped layout mode:</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scale Left</strong><br>
        <em>Show the sequence position for the first aligned residue in each row 
        in the left column of the alignment.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Scale Right</strong><br>
        <em>Show the sequence position for the last aligned residue in each row 
        in the right-most column of the alignment.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Scale Above</strong><br>
        <em>Show the alignment column position scale.</em></li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Show Sequence Limits<br>
    </strong><em>If this box is selected the sequence name will have the start 
    and end position of the sequence appended to the name, in the format NAME/START-END</em></li>
  <li><strong>Right Align Sequence ID<br>
    </strong> <em>If this box is selected then the sequence names displayed in 
    the sequence label area will be aligned against the left-hand edge of the 
    alignment display, rather than the left-hand edge of the alignment window.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Show Hidden Markers<br>
    </strong><em>When this box is selected, positions in the alignment where rows 
    and columns are hidden will be marked by blue arrows.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Boxes</strong><em><br>
    If this is selected the background of a residue will be coloured using the 
    selected background colour. Useful if used in conjunction with &quot;Colour 
    Text.&quot; </em></li>
  <li><strong>Text<br>
    </strong><em>If this is selected the residues will be displayed using the 
    standard 1 character amino acid alphabet.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Colour Text<br>
    </strong><em>If this is selected the residues will be coloured according to 
    the background colour associated with that residue. The colour is slightly 
    darker than background so the amino acid symbol remains visible. </em></li>
  <li><strong>Show Gaps<br>
    </strong><em>When this is selected, gap characters will be displayed as &quot;.&quot; 
    or &quot;-&quot;. If unselected, then gap characters will appear as blank 
    spaces. <br>
    You may set the default gap character in <a
		href="../features/preferences.html">preferences</a>.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Centre Column Labels<br>
    </strong><em>When this is selected, the text labels within each annotation row will be centred on the column that they are associated with.
