<ul>
  <li><strong>Fetch DB References</strong><br>
  <em>This will use any of the database services that Jalview is aware 
  of (e.g. DAS sequence servers and the WSDBFetch service provided by the EBI)
   to verify the sequence and retrieve all database cross references and PDB ids
   associated with all or just the selected sequences in the alignment.</em><br>
  </li>
  </ul>
    </strong> <em>Selecting one of the following menu items starts a remote service 
  on compute facilities at the University of Dundee. You need a continuous network 
  connection in order to use these services through Jalview. </em> </p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Alignment</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ClustalW Multiple Sequence Alignment</strong><br>
        <em> Submits all, or just the currently selected sequences for alignment 
        with clustal W.</em></li>
      <li><strong>ClustalW Multiple Sequence Alignment Realign</strong><br>
        <em> Submits the alignment or currently selected region for re-alignment 
        with clustal W. Use this if you have added some new sequences to an existing 
        alignment.</em></li>
      <li><strong>MAFFT Multiple Sequence Alignment</strong><br>
        <em>Submits all, or just the currently selected region for alignment with 
        MAFFT. </em> </li>
      <li><strong>Muscle Multiple Protein Sequence Alignment</strong><br>
        <em> Submits all, or just the currently selected sequences for alignment 
        using Muscle. Do not use this if you are working with nucleic acid sequences.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Secondary Structure Prediction</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>JPred Secondary Structure Prediction</strong><br>
        <em>Secondary structure prediction by network consensus. The behaviour 
        of this calculation depends on the current selection: </em></li>
      <li><em>If nothing is selected, and the displayed sequences appear to be 
        aligned, then a JNet prediction will be run for the first sequence in 
        the alignment, using the current alignment. Otherwise the first sequence 
        will be submitted for prediction. </em></li>
      <li><em>If just one sequence (or a region on one sequence) has been selected, 
        it will be submitted to the automatic JNet prediction server for homolog 
        detection and prediction. </em></li>
      <li><em>If a set of sequences are selected, and they appear to be aligned, 
        then the alignment will be used for a Jnet prediction on the <strong>first</strong> 
        sequence in the set (that is, the one that appears first in the alignment 
        window). </em> </li>
