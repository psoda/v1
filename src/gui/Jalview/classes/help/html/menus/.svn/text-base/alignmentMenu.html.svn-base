<p><strong>Alignment Window Menus</strong></p>
	<li><strong>File</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Fetch Sequence</strong><br>
		<em>Shows a dialog window in which you can select known ids from
		Uniprot, EMBL, EMBLCDS or PDB database using Web Services provided by
		the European Bioinformatics Institute. See <a
			href="../features/seqfetch.html">Sequence Fetcher</a></em>.</li>
		<li><strong>Add Sequences</strong><em><br>
		Add sequences to the visible alignment from file, URL, or cut &amp;
		paste window </em></li>
		<li><strong>Reload</strong><em><br>
		Reloads the alignment from the original file, if available.<br>
		<strong>Warning: This will delete any edits, analyses and
		colourings applied since the alignment was last saved, and cannot be
		undone.</strong></em></li>
		<li><strong>Save (Control S)</strong><em><br>
		Saves the alignment to the file it was loaded from (if available), in
		the same format, updating the original in place. </em></li>
		<li><strong>Save As (Control Shift S)<br>
		</strong><em>Save the alignment to local file. A file selection window
		will open, use the &quot;Files of type:&quot; selection box to
		determine which <a href="../io/index.html">alignment format</a> to
		save as.</em></li>
		<li><strong>Output to Textbox<br>
		</strong><em>The alignment will be displayed in plain text in a new
		window, which you can &quot;Copy and Paste&quot; using the pull down
		menu, or your standard operating system copy and paste keys. The
		output window also has a <strong>&quot;New Window&quot;</strong>
		button to import the (possibly edited) text as a new alignment.<br>
		Select the format of the text by selecting one of the following menu
		items.</em>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>FASTA</strong> <em></em></li>
			<li><strong>MSF</strong></li>
			<li><strong>CLUSTAL</strong></li>
			<li><strong>BLC</strong></li>
			<li><strong>PIR</strong></li>
			<li><strong>PFAM</strong></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Print (Control P)<br>
		</strong><em>Jalview will print the alignment using the current fonts and
		colours of your alignment. If the alignment has annotations visible,
		these will be printed below the alignment. If the alignment is wrapped
		the number of residues per line of your alignment will depend on the
		paper width or your alignment window width, whichever is the smaller.
		</em></li>
		<li><strong>Export Image</strong> <em><br>
		Creates an alignment graphic with the current view's annotation,
		alignment background colours and group colours. If the alignment is <a
			href="../features/wrap.html">wrapped</a>, the output will also be
		wrapped and will have the same visible residue width as the open
		alignment. </em>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>HTML<br>
			</strong><em>Create a <a href="../io/export.html">web page</a> from your
			alignment.</em></li>

		<li><strong>Export Annotations</strong><em><br>
		All annotations visible on the alignment can be saved to file or
		displayed in a textbox in Jalview annotations format. </em></li>
		<li><strong>Load Associated Tree<br>
		</strong><em>Jalview can <a href="../calculations/treeviewer.html">view
		trees</a> stored in the Newick file format, and associate them with the
		alignment. Note: the ids of the tree file and your alignment MUST be
		the same.</em></li>
		<li><strong>Load Features / Annotations<br>
		</strong><em>Load files describing precalculated <a
			href="../features/featuresFormat.html">sequence features</a> or <a
			href="../features/annotationsFormat.html">alignment annotations</a>.</em></li>
		<li><strong>Close (Control W)</strong><br>
		<em>Close the alignment window. Make sure you have saved your
		alignment before you close - either as a Jalview project or by using
		the <strong>Save As</strong> menu.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Edit</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Undo (Control Z)</strong><em><br>
		This will undo any edits you make to the alignment. This applies to
		insertion or deletion of gaps, cutting residues or sequences from the
		alignment or pasting sequences to the current alignment or sorting the
		alignment. <strong>NOTE:</strong> It DOES NOT undo colour changes,
		adjustments to group sizes, or changes to the annotation panel. </em></li>
		<li><strong>Redo (Control Y)<br>
		</strong><em>Any actions which you undo can be redone using redo. </em></li>
		<li><strong>Cut (Control X)<br>
		</strong><em>This will make a copy of the currently selected residues
		before removing them from your alignment. Click on a sequence name if
		you wish to select a whole sequence. <br>
		Use &lt;CTRL&gt; and X (&lt;APPLE&gt; and X on MacOSX) to cut.</em></li>
		<li><strong>Copy (Control C)</strong><br>
		<em>Copies the currently selected residues to the system
		clipboard - you can also do this by pressing &lt;CTRL&gt; and C
		(&lt;APPLE&gt; and C on MacOSX). <br>
		If you try to paste the clipboard contents to a text editor, you will
		see the format of the copied residues FASTA.</em></li>
		<li><strong>Paste </strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>To New Alignment (Control Shift V)<br>
			</strong><em>A new alignment window will be created from sequences
			previously copied or cut to the system clipboard. <br>
			Use &lt;CTRL&gt; and &lt;SHIFT&gt; and V(&lt;APPLE&gt; and
			&lt;SHIFT;&gt; and and V on MacOSX) to paste.</em></li>
			<li><strong>Add To This Alignment (Control V)<br>
			</strong><em>Copied sequences from another alignment window can be added
			to the current Jalview alignment. </em></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Delete (Backspace)<br>
		</strong><em>This will delete the currently selected residues without
		copying them to the clipboard. Like the other edit operations, this
		can be undone with <strong>Undo</strong>.</em></li>
		<li><strong>Remove Left (Control L)<br>
		</strong><em>If the alignment has marked columns, the alignment will be
		trimmed to the left of the leftmost marked column. To mark a column,
		mouse click the scale bar above the alignment. Click again to unmark a
		column, or select &quot;Deselect All&quot; to deselect all columns.</em></li>
		<li><strong>Remove Right (Control R)<br>
		</strong><em>If the alignment has marked columns, the alignment will be
		trimmed to the left of the leftmost marked column. To mark a column,
		mouse click the scale bar above the alignment. Click again to unmark a
		column, or select &quot;Deselect All&quot; to deselect all columns.</em></li>
		<li><strong>Remove Empty Columns (Control E)<br>
		</strong><em>All columns which only contain gap characters (&quot;-&quot;,
		&quot;.&quot;) will be deleted.<br>
		You may set the default gap character in <a
			href="../features/preferences.html">preferences</a>. </em></li>
		<li><strong>Remove All Gaps (Control Shift E)</strong><br>
		<em>Gap characters (&quot;-&quot;, &quot;.&quot;) will be deleted
		from the selected area of the alignment. If no selection is made, ALL
		the gaps in the alignment will be removed.<br>
		You may set the default gap character in <a
			href="../features/preferences.html">preferences</a>. </em></li>
		<li><strong>Remove Redundancy (Control D)<br>
		</strong><em>Selecting this option brings up a window asking you to select
		a threshold. If the percentage identity between any two sequences
		(under the current alignment) exceeds this value then one of the
		sequences (the shorter) is discarded. Press the &quot;Apply&quot;
		button to remove redundant sequences. The &quot;Undo&quot; button will
		undo the last redundancy deletion.</em></li>
		<li><strong>Pad Gaps<br>
		</strong><em>When selected, the alignment will be kept at minimal width
		(so there no empty columns before or after the first or last aligned
		residue) and all sequences will be padded with gap characters to the
		before and after their terminating residues.<br>
		This switch is useful when making a tree using unaligned sequences and
		when working with alignment analysis programs which require 'properly
		aligned sequences' to be all the same length.<br>
		You may set the default for <strong>Pad Gaps</strong> in the <a
			href="../features/preferences.html">preferences</a>. </em></li>

	<li><strong>Calculate</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Sort </strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>by ID</strong><em><br>
			This will sort the sequences according to sequence name. If the sort
			is repeated, the order of the sorted sequences will be inverted. </em></li>
			<li><strong>by Group</strong><strong><br>
			</strong><em>This will sort the sequences according to sequence name. If
			the sort is repeated, the order of the sorted sequences will be
			inverted. </em><strong></strong></li>
			<li><strong>by Pairwise Identity<br>
			</strong><em>This will sort the selected sequences by their percentage
			identity to the consensus sequence. The most similar sequence is put
			at the top. </em></li>
			<li><em>The <a href="../calculations/sorting.html">Sort

		</li>
		<li><strong>Extract Scores ... (optional)</strong><br>
		<em>This option is only visible if Jalview detects one or more white-space separated values in the description line of the alignment sequences.<br>
		When selected, these numbers are parsed into sequence associated annotation which can 
		then be used to sort the alignment via the Sort by&#8594;Score menu.</em> <br>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Autocalculate Consensus</strong><br>
		<em>For large alignments it can be useful to deselect
		&quot;Autocalculate Consensus&quot; when editing. This prevents the

		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Web Service<br>
	</strong> 
	  <ul><li><strong>Fetch DB References</strong><br>
  <em>This will use any of the database services that Jalview is aware 
  of (e.g. DAS sequence servers and the WSDBFetch service provided by the EBI)
   to verify the sequence and retrieve all database cross references and PDB ids
   associated with all or just the selected sequences in the alignment.</em><br>

			<li><strong>MAFFT Multiple Sequence Alignment</strong><br>
			<em>Submits all, or just the currently selected region for
			alignment with MAFFT. </em></li>
			<li><strong>Muscle Multiple Protein Sequence Alignment</strong><br>
			<em> Submits all, or just the currently selected sequences for

		</li>
		<li><strong>Secondary Structure Prediction</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>JPred Secondary Structure Prediction</strong><br>
			<em>Secondary structure prediction by network consensus. The
			behaviour of this calculation depends on the current selection: </em></li>
			<li><em>If nothing is selected, and the displayed sequences
			appear to be aligned, then a JNet prediction will be run for the
			first sequence in the alignment, using the current alignment.
			Otherwise the first sequence will be submitted for prediction. </em></li>
			<li><em>If just one sequence (or a region on one sequence)
			has been selected, it will be submitted to the automatic JNet
			prediction server for homolog detection and prediction. </em></li>
			<li><em>If a set of sequences are selected, and they appear
			to be aligned, then the alignment will be used for a Jnet prediction
			on the <strong>first</strong> sequence in the set (that is, the one
