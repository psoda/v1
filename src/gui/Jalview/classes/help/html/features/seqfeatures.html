<p><strong>Sequence Features</strong></p>
<p>Jalview can colour parts of a sequence based on the presence of
sequence features - which may be retrieved from database records (such
as Uniprot), the result of <a href="search.html">sequence motif
searches</a> or simply read from a <a
href="featuresFormat.html">sequence features file</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sequence Feature Groups</strong></p>
<p>Since Jalview 2.08, sequence features assigned to a sequence can be
organised into groups, which may indicate that the features were all retrieved
from the same database (such as Uniprot features), or generated by the
same analysis process (as might be specified in a <a
href="featuresFormat.html">sequence features file</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Sequence Feature Inheritance</strong></p>
<p>Since Jalview 2.08, sequence features are <em>global</em> to a set of
sequences appearing (independently or together) in many different
alignments. Practically, this means features loaded onto one alignment
can be viewed in any alignments involving the same sequences. The same
sequence appears in different alignments when a new alignment is
generated by submitting an existing set of sequences to one of the
alignment or prediction web services, and when sequences are copied
and pasted into other alignment windows.</p>
<p><strong>View&#8594;Show Sequence Features</strong></p>
<p>Toggle the display of sequence features in this alignment. If
feature retrieval has not already been carried out, then Jalview will
automatically try to fetch sequence features (as described below).</p>
<p><strong>View&#8594;Sequence Feature Settings...</strong>
<p>Once sequence features have been loaded, their display can be fully controlled 
  using the alignment window's <a
  href="featuresettings.html">Sequence Feature Settings</a> dialog box. Feature 
  colour schemes and display parameters are unique to a particular alignment, 
  so it is possible to colour the same sequence features differently in different 
  alignment views.<br>
  Since Jalview 2.1, it is possible to add <a href="dassettings.html">DAS features</a> 
  to an alignment via the DAS tabbed pane of the feature settings window. </p>
<p>Precalculated Sequence Features may be added to an alignment from the command
  line, drag and drop, or from the &quot;File-&gt;Load Features / Annotations&quot;
  menu item. See the <a href="featuresFormat.html">Features File Format</a> for
  more details.</p>
