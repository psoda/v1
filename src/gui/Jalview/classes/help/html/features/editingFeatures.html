<strong>Amending or Deleting Sequence Features</strong>
<p>Double clicking a position in the alignment with one or more
displayed sequence features opens the <strong>&quot;Amend/Delete
Features&quot;</strong> dialog box.</p>
<p><img src="amendfeature.gif"></p>
<p>The dialog box only allows one of the features at the
double-clicked position to be edited or deleted at a time, and it will
also be highlighted in black in the alignment window.</p>
<p>Choose which feature is to be modified by selecting it from the <strong>Sequence
Feature Name</strong> <!-- and <strong>Feature Group</strong>  --> pull down
menu. In addition to the Name, group, colour and description attributes
described for the <a href="creatinFeatures.html">new feature dialog
box</a>, a feature's start and end position can be changed either by
entering a new position directly or by using the adjacent up and down
buttons.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Amend</strong> to update the feature, <strong>Delete</strong>
to remove the selected feature, or <strong>Cancel</strong> to leave the
feature unchanged.</p>
<p><em>Sequence feature editing was implemented in Jalview 2.2</em></p>
