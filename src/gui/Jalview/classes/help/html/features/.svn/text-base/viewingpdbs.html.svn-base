<p><strong>Viewing PDB Structures</strong></p>
<p>Jalview can view protein structures associated with a sequence via the <strong>&quot;Structure&#8594;View 
  PDB entry:&quot;</strong> entries from a sequence's <a
  href="../menus/popupMenu.html">pop-up menu</a>. This will open an
  interactive display of the structure in a new window, or prompt you
  to associate the sequence with an existing view of the selected
  structure. See the <a href="jmol.html">Jmol PDB viewer</a> help page
  for more information about the display.
</p>
<p>To associate PDB files with a sequence, right click on a sequence ID and select 
  &quot;Structure<strong>&#8594;</strong> Associate Structure with Sequence&quot;, 
  and one of the submenus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>From File - You can load a PDB file from the local machine or network and 
    associate it with the selected sequence. PDB files associated in this way 
    will also be saved in the <a href="jalarchive.html">Jalview Archive file</a>. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Enter PDB Id - Jalview will use WSDBFetch, provided by the EBI, to fetch 
    the PDB file with the entered Id.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Discover PDB Ids - Jalview uses WSDBFetch, provided by the EBI, to discover 
    PDB ids for all the sequences in the alignment which have valid Uniprot names 
    / accession ids. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Importing PDB Entries or files in PDB format</strong><br>
You can retrieve sequences from the PDB using the <a
  href="seqfetch.html">Sequence Fetcher</a>. Any sequences retrieved with this 
  service are automatically associated with their source database entry. For PDB 
  sequences, simply select PDB as the database and enter your known PDB id (appended 
  with ':' and a chain code, if desired).
<br>Jalview will also read PDB files directly. Simply load in the file
as you would an alignment file. The sequences of any peptide chains
will be extracted from the file and viewed in the alignment window.
<br><em>Note for jalview applet users: due to the applet security
constraints, PDB Files can currently only be imported by cut and paste
of the PDB file text into the text box opened by the 'From File' entry
of the structure menu.</p>
<p><strong>Viewing the PDB Residue Numbering</strong><br>
Sequences which have PDB entry or PDB file associations are annotated
with sequence features from a group named with the associated PDB
accession number or file name. Each feature gives the corresponding
PDB Residue Number for each mapped residue in the seuqence. The
display of these features is controlled through the
<strong>&quot;View&#8594;Sequence Features&quot;</strong> menu item
and the <a href="featuresettings.html">Feature Settings dialog
box</a>.</p>
