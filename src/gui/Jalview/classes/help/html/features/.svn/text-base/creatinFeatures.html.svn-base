<strong>Creating Sequence Features</strong>
<p>Jalview can create sequence features from the matches of a <a
	href="search.html">regular expression search</a>, or from the currently
selected area via the <strong>&quot;selection&#8594;Create
sequence feature&quot;</strong> entry in the <a href="../menus/popupMenu.html">selection area popup menu</a>. In both
cases, the <strong>Create Features</strong> dialog box will then be
opened:</p>
<p><img src="crnewfeature.gif"></p>
<p>Select or enter the attributes for the features being created,
and then press OK to create the new features.</p>
<p>Each attribute is described below:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sequence Feature Name</strong>
	<p>Either give the new features a new name or use the menu to
	re-use an existing feature name.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Feature group</strong>
	<p>Enter a new group name, or re-use an existing group from the
	pull-down menu.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Feature Colour</strong>
	<p>Keep the existing colour for this feature's name and group, or
	select the colour box to open a colour chooser to pick a different one.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong>
	<p>Enter a description for all the features being created. Each
	feature defined on a sequence may have its own description that will be
	displayed in the tooltip for the feature in that region.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
