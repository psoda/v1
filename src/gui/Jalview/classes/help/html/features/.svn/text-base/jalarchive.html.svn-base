<p><strong>Jalview Project Archives</strong>
</p>

<p>These are java archives of an XML file containing alignments, trees and Jalview 
  display information. A data exchange standard is currently being developed, 
  so there is no stable schema yet, but Jalview web services will soon make use 
  of the same interchange format.</p>
<p>For those who want to know...<br>
  Jalview uses java classes automatically created using <a href="http://www.castor.org">Castor</a>. 
  Jalview 2.08 uses descriptor classes which significantly increase the speed 
  of marshalling / unmarshalling java objects into XML. Files created prior to 
  Jalview 2.08 can still be read in, but they will be saved in the new format.
