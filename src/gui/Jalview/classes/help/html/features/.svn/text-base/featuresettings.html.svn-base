<p><strong>Sequence Feature Settings Dialog Box</strong></p>

<p>The top section of the dialog box lists all the sequence feature
  groups, along with a tickbox for each that controls whether its
  features are displayed. The table in the middle lists all the
  features in the currently selected groups, along with their display
  colour and whether they are currently being displayed (only the
  ticked features and groups are displayed). <strong><em>You can change the
  colour used for a feature in the associated alignment by clicking on
  its colour box.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Transparency and Feature Ordering</strong></p><p>
  It is important to realise that sequence features are often not
  distinct and often overlap (for example, a metal binding site
  feature may be attached to one position along a stretch of sequence
  marked with a secondary structure feature).</p>
<p>The ordering of the sequence features in the dialog box list is the
  order used by jalview for rendering sequence features. A feature at
  the bottom of the list is rendered <em>below</em> a feature higher
  up in the list.<br><em><strong>You can change the order of a feature
  by dragging it up and down the list with the
  mouse</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Optimise order</em></strong> button (currently only available in the application) will re-order the feature render ordering based on the average length of each feature type.</p>
<p>
  The <strong><em>transparency slider setting</em></strong> (currently only available
  in the application version) controls the visibility of features
  rendered below other features. Reducing the transparency will mean
  that features at the top of the list can obscure features lower
  down, and increasing it allows the user to 'see through' the upper
  layers of a set of features.</p>
<p><strong><em>You can save all features, with their current colours and visibility 
  in a Jalview format file. </em></strong>
