<p><strong>DNA Sequence Coding Region Definition</strong></p>
<p>Jalview includes the standard DNA codon translation table in
order to be able to dynamically translate cDNA to its expressed
protein sequence. DNA Sequence Coding Regions are sequence 
features that can be defined on any DNA sequence in order to
mark stretches of cDNA that will be concatenated to form the
series of codons that are translated by the <strong>&quot;
Calculate&#8594;Translate cDNA&quot;</strong> menu function.
