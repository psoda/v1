<p><strong>Preferences</strong></p>
<p>There are four tabs in the Preferences dialog box: 
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="#visual"><strong>&quot;Visual&quot;</strong> Preferences</a> 
    tab allows you to configure the default display for a new alignment window. 
  </li>
  <li>The <a
  href="#connections"><strong>&quot;Connections&quot;</strong> Preferences</a> 
    tab allows you to change the links made from Jalview to your default web browser. 
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="#output"><strong>&quot;Output&quot;</strong> Preferences</a> 
    tab contains settings affecting the export of sequence alignments and EPS 
    files. </li>
  <li>The <a href="#editing"><strong>&quot;Editing&quot;</strong> Preferences</a> 
    tab contains settings affecting the export of sequence alignments and EPS 
    files.</li>
  <li>The <a href="#editing"><strong>&quot;DAS Settings&quot;</strong> Preferences</a> 
    tab allows you to select which DAS sources to use when fetching DAS Features.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong><a name="visual">Visual</a> Preferences tab</strong></p>
<p><em>Maximise Window</em> - If this is selected, a new alignment window will stretch 
  to fit the available space.</p>
<p><em>Open Overview Window</em> - When this is selected, the <a
  href="overview.html">alignment overview</a> panel is opened by
  default for a new alignment window.</p>
<p><em>Show Annotations</em> - If this is selected the new window will display an annotation 
  panel below the sequences. This annotation panel may have several rows describing 
  the whole alignment. The 3 standard annotations <em>Conservation</em>, <em>Quality</em> and <em>Consensus</em> 
  may be shown or hidden by default.</p>
<p><em>Full Sequence ID</em> - If selected the ID panel will display the name of a sequence 
  plus the start and end residues in the format name/start-end. If not selected, 
  the displayed ID will be the name of the sequence.</p>
<p><em>Right Align IDs</em> - select to align all sequence IDs to the
left-hand edge of the sequence alignment, rather than the left-hand
edge of the alignment display window.</p>
<p><em>Font</em> - The default font name, size and style can be set for a new 
  alignment window. </p>
<p><em>Sequence Name Italics</em> - select to apply the italicised
vbersion of the font to sequence labels.</p>
<p><em>Smooth Font</em> - Toggles anti-aliasing on / off for faster rendering 
  of the alignment.</p>
<p><em>Wrap Alignment</em> - Select whether to open new alignment windows in wrapped 
  mode or not.</p>
<p><em>Gap Symbol</em> - The default gap symbol may be set to either &quot;-&quot; or &quot;.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Colour</em> - The default colour scheme for a new alignment window. If 
  the chosen option is &quot;User Defined&quot; then the last User Defined Colour 
  loaded or saved via the User Defined Colours panel will be loaded. </p>
<p><em>Sort by</em> - When the alignment is loaded in, it will can be sorted by 
  Id or pairwise identity.</p>
<p><em>Open file</em> - If this is selected then the default alignment file will 
  be opened when Jalview is started. You can change the default file by clicking 
  on file name and either typing in the file path or selecting it from the file 
  chooser window. </p>
<p><a name="connections"><strong>&quot;Connections&quot; Preferences tab</strong></a></p>
<p><em>URL Link From Sequence ID</em><br>
  Right click a sequence id to see a popup menu with &quot;Link&quot; as one of 
  the items. By default the item &quot;SRS&quot; is added to this link menu. This 
  link will show a web page in your default browser with the selected sequence 
  id as part of the URL.<br>
  Jalview allows you to add your own custom links to other web pages. Click new 
  to add a new link. You can name the link, this will be displayed on a new menu 
  item under the &quot;Link&quot; menu when you right click on a sequence id. 
  <br>
  You must enter $SEQUENCE_ID$ within your URL. This will be replaced by the chosen 
  sequence id when you click on it. </p>
<p>eg.<br>
  UniRef100 = http://www.ebi.uniprot.org/uniprot-srv/uniRefView.do?proteinAc=$SEQUENCE_ID$&amp;library=uniref100<br>
  Swissprot = http://www.expasy.org/uniprot/$SEQUENCE_ID$
  <br>
  Links will also be made for any database cross references 
  associated with the sequence where the database name exactly 
  matches a URL link name. In this case, the $SEQUENCE_ID$ string will be replaced with 
  the accession string for the database cross-reference, rather than the 
  sequence ID for the sequence (<em>since Jalview 2.4</em>).
  <br>
  <strong>Regular Expression Substitution</strong><br>
  A url may contain a string of the form $SEQUENCE_ID=/<em>regular expression</em>/=$. In this case, the regular expression will be applied to the full sequence ID string and the resulting match will be inserted into the URL.
  Groups of parentheseses can be used to specify which regions of the regular expression will be used to generate the URL:
  <ul>
  <li>Each top level parenthesis will yield a URL containing the text matched within that parenthesis.
  </li>
  <li>Regions matching sub-parentheseses within a top-level parenthesis will be concatenated to form the text inserted into the URL for the top-level parenthesis.</li>
  <em>Please Note: the regular expressions supported by Jalview are those provided by the <a href="www.javaregex.com">Stevesoft javaregex package</a>. 
  <br>Many Thanks to Bernd Brand of the Free University of Amsterdam for testing this new regular-expression expansion feature!

  </p>
<p><em>Default Browser (Unix)</em><br>
  Its difficult in Java to detect the default web browser for Unix users. If Jalview 
  can't find your default web browser, enter the name or full path to your web 
  browser application. </p>
<p><em>Proxy Server</em><br>
  If you normally use a proxy server for using the internet, you must tick the 
  box &quot;Use a Proxy Server&quot; and enter the address and port details as 
  necessary. Web Services will not work if you are using a proxy server and do 
  not enter the settings here.</p>
<p><a name="output"><strong>Output Preferences tab</strong></a></p>
<p><em>EPS Rendering Style</em><br>
This is a selection box which allows the 
  user to set a default rendering style for EPS export: 
<ul><li>&quot;Lineart&quot;<br>EPS files will accurately
reproduce the alignment view in Jalview and all characters will be
converted into line art. Files generated in this way are large and are
not easily editable, but have no font table dependencies.</li>
<li>&quot;Text&quot;<br>EPS files will be a mixture of text and
lineart. This produces compact files that can be edited easily in
programs like Microsoft Word and Adobe Illustrator, but can be
problematic if the fonts available to jalview are not accessible by
the program reading the EPS file.
<li>&quot;Prompt each time&quot;<br>Choose this to be asked select between Lineart and Text each time you make an EPS file.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><em>Sequence//Start-End Numbering</em><br>
  The output tab also has a group of checkboxes for each file format. If these 
  are ticked, then Jalview will write files with the start and end sequence positions 
  appended to each sequence id:
<pre>
  >ID/1-10
  AACDEAAFEA
</pre>
<p>If the boxes are left unchecked for a particular format, the sequence limits 
  will not be appended to the sequence id. </p>
</p>
<p><em>Use Modeller Output</em></p>
<p>This option only applies to PIR format output. Jalview
  automatically reads PIR files with sequence descriptions compatible
  with the program <a
  href="http://salilab.org/modeller/">Modeller</a>.
  If this option is selected <a href="../io/modellerpir.html">Jalview will write Modeller style PIR
  files</a> with correct start/end numbering and PDB file association (if
  available). The Jalview id/start-end option is ignored if Modeller output is selected.
<p><a name="editing"><strong>Editing Preferences tab</strong></a></p>
<p>There are currently 2 options available which can be selected / deselected. 
</p>
<p><em>AutoCalculate Consensus</em> - For large alignments it can be useful to 
  deselect &quot;Autocalculate Consensus&quot; when editing. This prevents lengthy 
  calculations which are performed after each sequence edit. New alignment windows 
  will have their &quot;Autocalculate Consensus&quot; option set according to 
  this setting. </p>
<p><em>Pad gaps when editing</em> - New alignment windows will &quot;Pad Gaps&quot; 
  according to this setting.</p>
