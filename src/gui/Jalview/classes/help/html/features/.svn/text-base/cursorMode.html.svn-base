<p><strong>Cursor Mode</strong></p>
<p>Cursor mode is a new feature in Jalview 2.08, and allows more
precise selection and editing of alignments through the use of the
keyboard for both navigation and the input of editing and selection commands.</p>
<p><em>F2</em> Toggles between normal and cursor editing modes. When
in cursor mode, a black cursor appears in the residue area of the
alignment, and any mouse clicks on that area will move the cursor to
that position (this means that the region selection menu is
unavailable in cursor mode).</p>
<p><b>Navigation</b>
<ul>
  <li>Cursor keys - Move cursor around the alignment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>S - Type a number x then press 'S' to jump to sequence x.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>C - Type a number x then press 'C' to jump to column x.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>P - Type a number x then press 'P' to jump to position x in current sequence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>65,82&lt;return&gt; - Quick jump to column 65, sequence 82</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Defining Regions</b>

  <li>Q - Define the top left corner of the selection area</li>

<ul>
  <li>M - Define the bottom right corner of the selection area<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Editing The Alignment</b>
<ul>
