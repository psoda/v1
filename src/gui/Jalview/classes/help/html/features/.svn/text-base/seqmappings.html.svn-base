<p><strong>Mapping Between Different Sequences</strong></p>
<p>A new feature in Jalview 2.3 is the ability to map between sequences in different 
  domains, based on alignment, or by the use of explicit mappings provided by 
  databases. </p>
<p>The most familiar mapping is the one used to identify
the coordinates corresponding to a displayed sequence when
viewing a PDB file associated with a sequence (see 
<a href="viewingpdbs.html">&quot;Viewing PDB Files&quot;</a> 
for more information.</p>
<p>The newest form of mapping supported by Jalview is the 
correspondence between DNA and protein sequences. This mapping
can be imported directly from EMBL and EMBLCDS database records 
retrieved by the <a href="seqfetch.html">Sequence Fetcher</a>, 
and allows sequence features to be mapped directly from Uniprot 
das sources to their coding region on EMBL sequence records.
