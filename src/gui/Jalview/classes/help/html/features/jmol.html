<p><strong>The Jmol PDB Viewer</strong>
<p>The interactive structure viewing window is opened by selecting
the <strong>&quot;Sequence&#8594;View PDB entry:&quot;</strong> entry in
the <a href="../menus/popupMenu.html">sequence id pop-up menu</a>. This
can only be done for sequences which have an <a href="viewingpdbs.html">associated
PDB structure</a>.
<p>Since Jalview 2.3, <a href="http://jmol.sourceforge.net/">Jmol</a>
has been integrated into Jalview. It is automatically used by the
application, and should also run in the applet in all latest web
browsers. If jmol is not available, then the original <a
href="pdbviewer.html">internal pdb viewer</a> will be used as a fallback.
</p>
<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>
<p>The structure is by default rendered as a ribbon diagram. Moving the
mouse over the structure brings up tooltips giving the residue name,
PDB residue number and chain code, atom name and number
([RES]Num:Chain.AtomName#AtomNumber). If a mapping exists to a residue
in any associated sequences, then this will be highlighted in each
one's alignment window. The converse also occurs - moving the mouse
over an associated residue in an alignment window highlights the associated
atoms in the displayed structures.</p>
<p>Selecting a residue highlights its associated sequence residue
and alpha carbon location. Double clicking an atom allows distances to
be measured from it to any other atom in the structure.</p>

<p>The window has four menus:

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Save As<br>
		</strong><em>Save the displayed PDB File, or the current view as an EPS or PNG file.</em></li>
		<li><strong>View Mapping<br>
		</strong><em> Opens a text window showing the alignment between the
		residues corresponding to alpha-carbon atoms in the PDB structure and
		the residues in the associated sequence.</em></li>

		corresponding residue in the associated sequence as rendered in the
		associated alignment view, including any Uniprot sequence features or
		region colourings.<br>
		Residues which only exist in the PDB structure are coloured white if
		they are insertions (relative to the associated sequence in the

		<li><strong>By Chain<br>
		</strong><em> Assigns a random colour to each PDB chain.</em>
		<li><strong>Charge &amp; Cysteine<br>

<p><strong>Functionality provided by Jmol</strong>
</p><p>The Jmol menu provides access to a number of features for
controlling the colour and display of molecules, adding measurements and
labels, plotting surfaces, and display animation. The 'Set Picking'
menu controls the behaviour of single and double mouse clicking on the
structure.</p>
<p>The state of each Jmol display is stored within <a
href="jalarchive.html">jalview archives</a> as a jmol state recovery script
file. This means that any Jmol visualization effects that
you add beyond those provided by Jalview will be able to be stored and
recovered along with the displayed alignments in Jalview.
</p><p><strong>More Information</strong>
</p><p>Jmol is a sophisticated program in its own right, with its own
command console and scripting language. Only the essentials have been
described here - the interested reader is referred to 
<a href="http://jmol.sourceforge.net/docs/">Jmol's own comprehensive
online documenation</a>.</p></p>
