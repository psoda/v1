<p><strong>Hidden Regions</strong></p>
<p>Use the keyboard key &quot;H&quot; to hide / reveal selected
columns and sequences. To hide / reveal only selected sequences, use
&quot;Shift H&quot;, to hide / reveal only selected columns, use
&quot;Control H&quot;.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hiding Sequences</em></strong><br>
To hide selected sequences in an alignment, use the <strong>&quot;View
-&gt; Hide -&gt; Selected Sequences&quot;</strong> menu item or simply select <strong>&quot;Hide
Sequences&quot;</strong> from the Popup menu after a right click on the sequence
Ids.</p>
<p>Hidden sequences will not be used in any calculations, editing or
web service alignments performed on visible sequences.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hidden Sequences Representatives</em></strong><br>
A more advanced hide involves a right-mouse click on a sequence, then
selecting <strong>&quot;SequenceID -&gt; Represent Group with
SequenceId&quot;</strong>. Using this method of hiding sequences, any edits
performed on the visible group representative will be propogated to all
the sequences in that group. <br>
The hidden representative sequences will not be used in any calculations
or web service alignments (<em>nb. this may change in the future</em>).
<p><strong><em>Hidden Sequence Representatives and
Multiple Views</em></strong><br>
<em>A word of warning: hidden representative sequence groups are
only partly implemented in the jalview 2.2 release, and the following
issues will be resolved in the future.</em><br>
Currently, represented hidden groups are only made correctly if there is
just one alignment view. When multiple views on an alignment exist, then
the represented group will be displayed correctly in the view in which
it was made, but in other views, both representative and hidden
sequences will be visible, but will behave as if they are grouped. <br>
Hidden representatives are propagated correctly to a new view if they
exist in the current view. However, if the represented sequences are
revealed in any one view, then in all other views they will simply be
marked as hidden, and their association with the representative sequence
will be lost.<br>

<p><strong><em>Hiding Columns</em></strong><br>
To hide selected columns in an alignment, use the <strong>&quot;View
-&gt; Hide -&gt; Selected Columns&quot;</strong> menu item, or right click within
a region of selected columns in the scale above the alignment (only
available in non wrapped mode) and select <strong>&quot;Hide
Columns&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>When an alignment view contains hidden columns, certain
constraints apply:
<ul>
	<li>Editing the alignment is bound by the hidden columns, <em>i.e.</em>
	you cannot move residues across a hidden column boundary.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../calculations/tree.html">Tree</a></strong>,
	<strong><a href="../calculations/pairwise.html">pairwise
	alignment</a></strong> and <strong><a href="../calculations/pca.html">PCA</a></strong>
	calculations will only be performed using the <em>visible</em> parts of
	the alignment.</li>
	<li><a href="../webservices/msaclient.html">Multiple Sequence
	Alignments</a> are performed locally on on each visible chunk of the input,
	and concatenated with the hidden regions to form the final result.
	</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Column Separability</strong><br>
Calculations where hidden columns are excluded, and a single analysis
performed on the result, are termed <em>column-separable</em>. The
simple Tree and PCA calculations are column separable because
essentially the same results would be obtained if the excluded hidden
columns were replaced by gaps as the input to the calculation.</p>
<p>Multiple Sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction
are both non-column-separable, and so the exclusion of hidden regions
leads to only 'locally optimal' results - sometimes different to that
obtained when using the full alignment.</p>
