 <p><strong>Running Jalview from the command line</strong></p>
 <p>Jalview is most easily run from the command line if you have built
 it from source, or via the 'Jalview' executable created from the
 InstallAnywhere jalview installation. Both of these mechanisms allow
 true command line execution of jalview - allowing you to provide
 additional options.</p><p>
The Java Webstart version of
 jalview can be executed from the command line using something like
 :
 <pre>javaws http://www.jalview.org/webstart/jalview.jnlp -open
 <em>yourFileName</em></pre>
 But, this is not guaranteed to work on all versions of webstart on all
 operating systems, and doesn't let you execute Jalview with any
 additional parameters.
 <p><strong>Running jalview from the InstallAnywhere
 installation</strong></p>
 <p>If you install with InstallAnywhere you can use several more commands. 
 However, if you call the application with the link provided by InstallAnywhere 
 any output from the application will be sent to output.txt, not standard 
 out.<br>
 The jalview application also requires a number of additional
 libraries on the class path. The command line below adds the Jalview
 installation's 'lib' directory to the list of directories that are
 searched for jars to be added to the classpath:</p>
<pre>java -Djava.ext.dirs=$INSTALL_DIR$/lib -cp $INSTALL_DIR$/jalview.jar jalview.bin.Jalview -open [FILE] </pre>
 <p>Use '-help' to get more information on the <a
 href="clarguments.html">command line arguments</a> that Jalview
 accepts.</p>
