        <p><strong>Web services</strong></p>
        
        <p>Jalview includes clients for a variety of web services for both bioinformatic data retrieval and analysis.
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../features/seqfetcher.html">Sequence Fetcher</a> utilises web services for sequence, alignment and structure retrieval provided by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and Distributed Annotation System servers that are capable of serving sequences.</li>
<li>The DAS Feature Fetcher enables the retrieval and visualization of features from DAS annotation sources</li>
<li>Jalview SOAP Web Services for sequence and alignment analysis are provided by the University of Dundee, and are available from the Alignment window's <strong> 
  Web Service</strong> menu.</li></ul>
</p>
            <p>Jalview's distributed computations are SOAP based services exposing
              protein sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction programs. These services actually run
                on the cluster based in the School of Life Sciences, University of
                  Dundee, and are maintained by the Barton group.

                  <p><strong>Web Service Dialog Box</strong></p>
<img src="clwqueued.gif">
<p>
                  This dialog box is displayed when a web service job
                  is submitted. It gives the name of the service and
                  any method citation information, and monitors the
                  progress of the calculation. The cancel button will
                  permanently cancel the job, but this is only
                  possible for some services.
                  </p>
                  <p>Current services:
                  <ul><a href="msaclient.html"><strong>Multiple
                  Sequence Alignment Services</strong></a><ul>
                  <li><a href="clustalw.html">ClustalW Multiple Alignment and re-alignment</a><br>
                  The clustal W service remains one of the more
                  popular Jalview features.
                  </li>
                  <li><a href="muscle.html">Muscle Multiple Alignment</a><br>
                  High Quality and High Throughput multiple alignments of proteins. This
                  method can sometimes be more accurate than ClustalW when dealing with
                  diverse sets of sequences.
                  </li>
                  <li><a href="mafft.html">MAFFT</a><br>
                  Multiple Alignment with Fast Fourier Transforms -
                  a highly accurate and high throughput dna and amino
                  acid alignment method, performing at least as well
                  as ClustalW and Muscle.
                  </li>
                  </ul>                  
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Secondary Structure Prediction</strong>
                  <ul>
                  <li><a href="jnet.html">JNet</a><br>This is a front end to the existing <a
                  href="http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-jpred/">JNet
                  www server</a> allowing single sequence or profile
                  based prediction.
                  </li>
                  </ul>

                  </p>
                  <p>Watch this space! These are some of the services
                  planned to be released soon:<ul>
                  <li>Repeat analysis
                  </li>
                  <li>Remote Homology Detection<br>
                  </li>
                  </ul>
                  In the future, Jalview will also be able to new discover services
                  dynamically, and distribute expensive analysis functions like <a
                  href="../calculations/pca.html">PCA</a> to the Dundee machines.</p>
