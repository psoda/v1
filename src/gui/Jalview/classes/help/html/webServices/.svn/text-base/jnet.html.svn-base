<strong>JNet Secondary Structure Prediction</strong>
<p>Secondary structure prediction methods attempts to infer the
likely secondary structure for a protein based on its amino acid
composition and similarity to sequences with known secondary structure.
The JNet method uses several different neural networks and decides on
the most likely prediction via a jury network. <br>

The function available from the
<strong>Web Service&#8594;Secondary Structure
Prediction&#8594;JNet Secondary Structure Prediction</strong>
menu does two different kinds of prediction, dependent upon the
currently selected region:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>If nothing is selected, and the displayed sequences appear to
	be aligned, then a JNet prediction will be run for the first sequence
	in the alignment, using the current alignment. Otherwise the first
	sequence will be submitted for prediction.</li>
	<li>If just one sequence (or a region on one sequence) has been
	selected, it will be submitted to the automatic JNet prediction server
	for homolog detection and prediction.</li>
	<li>If a set of sequences are selected, and they appear to be
	aligned, then the alignment will be used for a Jnet prediction on the <strong>first</strong>
	sequence selected in the set (that is, the one nearest the top of the
	alignment window).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: JNet secondary structure prediction is a
'non-column-separable' service - predictions are based on the sequence
profile of contiguous stretches of amino-acid sequence. A prediction
will only be made on the visible parts of a sequence (see <a
	href="../features/hiddenRegions.html">hiding columns</a>) as if it were
a contiguous polypeptide chain. Prediction accuracy at the hidden column
boundaries may therefore be less than indicated by JNet's own
reliability score (see below).</p>
<p>The result of a JNet prediction for a sequence is a new annotated
alignment window:</p>
<img src="jnetprediction.gif">
<p>The sequence for which the prediction was made is the first one
in the alignment. If a sequence based prediction was made then the
remaining sequences in the alignment are the aligned parts of homologs
which were used to construct a sequence profile for the prediction. If
the prediction was made using a multiple alignment, then the original
multiple alignment will be returned, annotated with the prediction.</p>
The annotation bars below the alignment are as follows:

	<li>Lupas_21, Lupas_14, Lupas_28<br>
	<em>Coiled-coil predictions for the sequence. These are binary
	predictions for each location.</em></li>
	<li>JNETSOL25,JNETSOL5,JNETSOL0<br>
	<em>Solvent accessibility predictions - binary predictions of 25%,
	5% or 0% solvent accessibility.</em></li>
	<li>JNetPRED<br>
	<em>The consensus prediction - helices are marked as red tubes,
	and sheets as dark green arrows.</em></li>
	<li>JNetCONF<br>
	<em>The confidence estimate for the prediction. High values mean
	high confidence. prediction - helices are marked as red tubes, and
	sheets as dark green arrows.</em></li>

	<em>Alignment based prediction - helices are marked as red tubes,

	<em>Amino Acid frequency based prediction - helices are marked as

	<li>JNETJURY<br>
	<em>A '*' in this annotation indicates that the JNETJURY was
	invoked to rationalise significantly different primary predictions.</em></li>
