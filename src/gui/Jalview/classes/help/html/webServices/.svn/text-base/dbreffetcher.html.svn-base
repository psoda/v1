Database Reference Fetching
</head>
<p>
<p><strong>Discovering Database References for Sequences</strong><br>
Database references are associated with a sequence are displayed as a
list in the tooltip shown when mousing over its sequence ID. Jalview
uses references for the retrieval of <a
	href="../features/viewingpdbs.html">PDB structures</a> and <a
	href="../features/dasfeatures.html">DAS features</a>, and for
retrieving sequence cross-references such as the protein products of a
DNA sequence.</p>
<p>Jalview discovers references for a sequence by generating a set
of ID queries from the ID string of each sequence in the alignment. It
then tries to query all the databases it can access in order to match
the alignment sequence to any records retrieved from the database. If a
match is found, then the sequence is annotated with that database's
reference, and any cross-references that it's records contain.</p>
<p><strong>The Sequence Identification Process</strong><br>
The method of accession id discovery is derived from the method which
earlier Jalview versions used for Uniprot sequence feature retrieval,
and was originally restricted to the identifaction of valid Uniprot
accessions.<br>
Essentially, Jalview will try to retrieve records from all the databases
accessible by the <a href="../features/seqfetch.html">sequence
fetcher</a> using each sequence's ID string (or each string in the ID
separated by the '&#8739;' symbol).</p>
<p>If a record (or set of records) is retrieved by any query derived
from the ID string of a sequence, then the sequence is aligned to the
ones retrieved to determine the correct start and end residue positions
(which are displayed when the 'Show Full Sequence ID' option). This is
important for the correct display of the location of any features
associated with that database.</p>
<p>If the alignment reveals differences between the sequence in the
alignment and the one in the record, then Jalview will assume that the
aligned sequence is not the one in the retrieved record.</p>
<p>In some cases, the ID used to retrieve records may be out
of date and a dialog box will be opened indicating that a 100% match
between the sequence and the record was identified, but the
sequence name is different. In this case, the can be manually
changed (by right clicking on the sequence ID and selecting <strong>Sequence&#8594;Edit
Name</strong>).
<ul>
	<li><em>Note</em><br>
	Please remember to save your alignment if either the start/end
	numbering, or the sequence IDs were updated during the ID
	retrieval process.</li>
</ul>
