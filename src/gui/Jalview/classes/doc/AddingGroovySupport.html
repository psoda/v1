Adding Groovy Support to Jalview
</h1>
<p>
There is currently no scripting language 
extension within Jalview, in part because a 
scripting API has not yet been developed.
</p>
<p>It is, however, really easy to embed scripting
engines like groovy. If groovy is detected on the 
classpath, a new menu entry on the Desktop's Tools 
menu will open the GroovyShell.
</p>
<p>Here are some scripts to get you started:</p>
<ul><li>Getting the title, alignment and first sequence from the current alignFrame<br>
<pre>
def alf = Jalview.getAlignframes();
print alf[0].getTitle();
def alignment = alf[0].viewport.alignment;
def seq = alignment.getSequenceAt(0);
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Getting Groovy...</h1>
<p>
You need the core groovy jars which include the GroovyShell. The easiest way of doing
this is to add the groovy-all-*.jar to the lib directory whose path is given in the java.ext.dirs property.</p>
<p>The is obtained from the <em>embedded</em> directory within the <a 
href="http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/distributions"/>groovy distribution</a>).
</p>
<h2>TODO</h2>
<p>
Using Java class methods from Groovy is straightforward, but currently, there isn't a set of easy to use methods for the jalview objects. A Jalview Scripting API needs to be developed to make this easier.</p>
<h3>Making it easier</h3>
<p>jalview.bin.JalviewScript could be a top level jalview instance of a script execution thread, creating and maintaining the context for scripts operating on the jalview datamodel and interfacing with the Jalview GUI.
