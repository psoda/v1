<h1>Building Jalview from Source</h1>
<P>
<p>
You will need the following (hopefully):<br>
<ul>
<li>Java development kit (we used JDK1.4SE but JDK1.5 will work too,
and maybe even jikes).
<li>Ant (we think 1.5.4 is quite sufficient to use the simple build
file supplied).
</ul>
With any luck, after setting your paths and JAVA_HOME correctly, you
just need to change to the Jalview directory and run ant (this works
from JBuilder and eclipse too).
<pre>
   ant
</pre>

</p>
<p><strong>Building a webstart version of jalview</strong></p>
Jalview depends on several libraries contained in the libs directory
of the distribution.  In order to access them, they must all be signed
jars - using the same jarsigner key as jalview itself. There is a
build target in ant to make the signed jar files in a directory called
dist. But first you need to make your own key:
<p><strong>Making your own key</strong></p>

<p>The ant 'makefulldist' target assumes that a keystore exists in a
directory 'keys'. To make a key accessible using the default settings
in the build.xml file then make the keys directory and add the
jarsigner key with the following :
</p>
<pre>
mkdir keys
keytool -genkey -keystore keys/.keystore -keypass alignmentisfun
-storepass alignmentisfun -alias jalview
 (you will have to answer some personal questions here)
ant makedist
 (should eventually generate a Jalview.jnlp file
  in ./dist along with a set of signed jars using the jalview
  key)
</pre>
