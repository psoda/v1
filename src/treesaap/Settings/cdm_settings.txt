[ CDM User Input Values ]

[ Calculations ]
1.	autoTransBias	true	[ Whether CDM determines the transition bias ]
2.	transitionBias	0.0	[ The user-specified transition bias, autoTransBias must be false ]
3.	deriveTS4	false	[ How CDM determines ts4 - either it derives it or it uses a set of equations ]
4.	fixedTransBias	false	[ Whether to fix the transbias of CDM at one value, or to recalculate it for each window ]
