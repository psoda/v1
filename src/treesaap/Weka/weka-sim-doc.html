<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>weka-sim is a class that predicts the secondary structure of amino acid sequences. It uses a neural network generated by Weka.</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The output of weka-sim can be observed in the secondary structure column of the output screen of TreeSAAP</p>

<h2>Using different neural networks</h2>
<p>
No neural network is perfect and it is possible a different neural network would produce more accurate predictions for a particular set of sequences. The neural networks are kept in the Data\SECONDARY_STRUCTURES directory off the main trunk of TreeSAAP. The file used by default is named secondarystructure.txt. Also contained in this directory is a zip file with a few hundred more neural network files. To use one of these alternate files simply copy the desired file over secondarystructure.txt. To create your own neural network see the corresponding section below.
</p>

<h2>Format of neural network file</h2>
<p>
The first few lines of the neural network file list the chemical property names that were used to train the file. This information is used by weka-sim so it used the correct chemical property values when running its simulations. The remaining neural network file corresponds to the standard output of Weka. This is parsed by weka-sim to read in the neural network for use in running simulations. This file has a few requirements in order to be parsed correctly.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The window size must be odd</li>
<li>Attribute variables that correspond to chemical properties must be named aaXXcpYY (where XX and YY are integers)</li>
<li>A boolean variable that indicates if the chemical property is present must be named aaXXPresent (where XX is an integer and corresponds to the chemical property named aaXXcpYY)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Weka-sim supports an arbitrary number of nodes.

<h2>Creating your own neural network</h2>
<p>
New neural network files can be generated using weka. The scripts that were used for creating the provided neural networks can be found in Data\SECONDARY_STRUCTURES\scripts.zip. See the accompanying README file for details on how to use the scripts.
